# imgp

Command line tool for simple image transforming operations written in pure Rust. It is basically a CLI wrapper around [image](https://docs.rs/image/0.20.0/image/).

### Why
Two main reasons: 

1. I wanted to do a useful (see 2) small-scoped project in Rust
2. Too many times I had to open up some heavy duty image processing program (Photoshop, Previewer, etc) do some very simple image transformation such as rotation or a resize.

### Usage
See `> imgp -h` for all instructions but here is the gist of it:

`> imgp <source> -d <destination> -...

### What it does
Currently supported:

- copying
- rotating
- resizing
